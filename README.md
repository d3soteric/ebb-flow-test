# RES5901
Repo for work related to my second research paper for the SANS Technical Institute

the res_infra.json template is really all you need to replicate the simulation environment.  
I don't include a purposefully vulnerable test server but that can be easily built as needed and if desired

The res_storage.json template is not needed unless you want to mess with setting flow logs to go to s3 buckets created in other accounts (abandoned by me because CloudWatch was simpler for my testing)
